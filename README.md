## Project Background

This project was initially developed as part of the 100 Days of Python course on Udemy. While the course provided the list of characters (letters, numbers, and symbols) used for generating passwords, the rest of the code—including the structure, logic, and additional features—was created entirely by me.

Specifically, I built on the course material by:

- Implementing a PasswordGenerator class to organize the password generation logic.
- Adding password regeneration functionality to reuse previous settings.
- Storing and managing a history of generated passwords for easy reference.
- Designing a menu-driven CLI interface for user interaction.
