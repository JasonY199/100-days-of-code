# Turtle Dot Painting

In this project, I completed a number of challenges using the turtle module in Python. The turtle module allows you to draw shapes and patterns on the screen. I also created a dot painting using the turtle module at the end of the project.

## How to run the project

1. Ensure Python 3.13.x is installed on your system (what I was using during development of this program)

2. Clone the repository

    ```git clone https://github.com/JasonY199/100days-turtle-dot-painting.git```

3. Open the terminal and navigate to the project directory

    ```cd turtle-dot-painting```

4. Create a virtual environment by running the command:

    ```python3 -m venv venv```

5. On Mac, activate the virtual environment by running the command:

    ```source venv/bin/activate```

6. Install the dependencies by running the command:

    ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

7. 
   1. Run the first couple challenges by running the command (don't forget to uncomment the specific challenge in the main.py file that you want to run first.)

        ```python3 main.py```
    
    2. Draw the dot painting by running the command:

        ```python3 dot.py```
